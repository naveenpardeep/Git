Branches
Branches are an important part of working with Git. Any commits you make will be made on the branch you’re currently “checked out” to. Use git status to see which branch that is.

to see the list of branches   $git branch   

$ git branch [branch-name]

Creates a new branch

$ git switch -c [branch-name]

Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory

$ git merge [branch]

Combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch. This is usually done in pull requests, but is an important Git operation.

$ git branch -d [branch-name]
you must not be in that particular branch like if you want to delete the branch day3 and from day4 branch then
git branch -d day4

Deletes the specified branch
